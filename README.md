# Head-Pose-Estimation-using-Deep-Neural-Network
Head Pose Estimation using Deep Neural Network

The main goal of this assignment is to build a deep convolutional neural network to predict tilt and pan angles of
unseen image of a person. . In this project, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the head pose of the given image of a person
